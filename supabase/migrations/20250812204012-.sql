-- Enhanced security for orders table: Create function to validate payment field updates
-- This prevents service role from modifying sensitive customer PII during payment processing

-- First, create a function to validate that only payment-related fields are being updated
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.validate_payment_update()
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- This function will be used in RLS policy to ensure only payment fields can be updated
  -- It's a placeholder that returns true - the actual validation will be in the WITH CHECK
  RETURN true;
END;
$$;

-- Drop the previous policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can update payment fields only" ON public.orders;

-- Create a more restrictive service role update policy
-- Only allow updating specific payment-related columns, block customer PII updates
CREATE POLICY "Service role can update payment status only" 
ON public.orders 
FOR UPDATE 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (
  -- Allow updates only to payment-related fields by checking if sensitive fields remain unchanged
  -- This prevents modification of customer PII while allowing payment processing
